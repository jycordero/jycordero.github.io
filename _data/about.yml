  Hi, I am Joseph a Physics Ph.D. student in the field of Physics. Along my development professionally and personally, I have placed myself in situations where I had to learn the skills sets on the go. I like to work in teams where I can validate or kill ideas fast and I am very open minded to constructive critism as I see it as an important aspect of fast growth. In the last 5 years I have had to be a physicist. engineer, programmer, machinist, plommer, laser operator, and others.
