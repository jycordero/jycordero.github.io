  In my almost 10 years of research experience, I have had to adapt to the demands the projects require. As a result, I have acquired a diverse skill set that includes laser operation, machining design and handling, electrical engineering know-how, and  programming. Additionally, I like to work in teams where I can validate or kill ideas fast and I am very open minded to constructive criticism as I see it as an important aspect of fast growth.
